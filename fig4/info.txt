The file contains the following columns:
- Col1: Relative bond length (a/a0). This used as the x-axis, where we multiplied it by 1.112 Angstrom to show the real nuclear separation
- Col2: 1/chi, used as x-axis
- Col3: Ground state energy obtained using CA-DMRG with bond dimension 60
- Col4: Ground state energy obtained using CA-DMRG with bond dimension 80
- Col5: Ground state energy obtained using DMRG with bond dimension 60
- Col6: Ground state energy obtained using DMRG with bond dimension 80
- Col7 - Col10: Absolute error calculated as |E - E(FCI) energy|, for the energies in Col2 - Col5. This is plotted as the inset.
- Col11: FCI energies for reference
- Col12: RHF energies for comparison
All energies are in unit Hartree.
