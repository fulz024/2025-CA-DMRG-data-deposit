### Data deposition for manuscript: *Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group for* ab initio *quantum chemistry* (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.16026)

Each folder contains the data needed to create the corresponding figures in the manuscript.

Data and figures in this manuscript are organized using the OriginPro software. Each `.dat` file given here is created by copying data (with full precision) from the worksheets to a text file.
